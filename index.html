            I am Dhiraj Gurung, an interdependent global health advocate and a co-founder & Connector-in-Chief of Health Connection; an
            organization that aims to bridge the linguistic and cultural gap between healthcare professionals and ethnic minorities
            in Hong Kong.
            <p>
            Personally, I believe in the power of cross-curricular learning, technology, design, and positivity. Moreover, I am
            fascinated by people, places & cultures while I also love photography to make memories and tell stories.I have a strong
            passion, compassion and motivation for health education & promotion, interdisciplinary education and social innovation
            to reduce health disparities.</p>
            <p>
            In the field of public health, I have involved in health screening and promotion programmes, while lately I manage and
            supervise the master of public health students concerning their practicums. I also have worked as a medical interpreter
            and translator in different healthcare settings and I have experience of serving as a trainer of medical interpretation
            and translation. Moreover, I have also succeeded in starting and running community projects in the fields of health
            communication, community integration and social justice.</p>
            <p>
            Outside of the public health domain, I have worked with diverse ethnic minority students in primary and secondary
            schools as a teacher. I also have served as a volunteer and ambassador for different organizations where I leveraged
            connections, networks and resources to develop actions to achieve the mission of the organizations. I am an avid learner
            of more than knowledge and I believe in the power of cross-curricular learning, interdependence and positivity. I am
            fascinated by people, stories, and cultures while I enjoy photography, travelling, and listening to podcasts.
            </p>
            <p>
            Currently, while I am looking for an opportunity in an organization where I can use my strengths and abilities to work
            together with like-minded people to create an opportunity for everyone to lead a healthy life, I am enrolled in Health
            Innovation & Entrepreneurship programme to learn innovation as well as entrepreneurial processes to understand and
            develop new ideas for creating impact & improving healthcare at Ghent University.</p>
