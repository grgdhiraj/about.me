Hello!
<p>I am Dhiraj Gurung, a Nepalese Hong Konger currently residing in Belgium. I am an interdependent global health advocate who is passionately curious about many subjects. </p>

<p>After graduating from medical school, I went to work as a volunteer for the wireless telemedicine project in rural Nepal. That experience changed my career decision. Instead of working in a hospital setting as a doctor, I thought of working on health promotion.   Returning to Hong Kong, I discovered there were health, as well as social problems in ethnic minorities and the less-privileged populations. Including that awareness encouraged me to pursue my education path toward public health. </p>

<p>After graduation from the school of public health, following different career paths and gaining experiences, I co-founded Health Connection with support from MaD Accumulator Scheme! The aim of this organization to bridge the linguistic and cultural gap between healthcare professionals and ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, for which I serve as a Connector-in-Chief, building the team as well as connecting the organization to other institutes and organizations.</p>

<p>I believe in the power of cross-curricular learning, technology, design, and positivity. Moreover, I am fascinated by people, places & cultures while I also love photography to make memories and tell stories. I have a strong passion, compassion and motivation for health education & promotion, interdisciplinary education and social innovation to reduce health disparities.</p>

<p>In the field of public health, I have involved in health screening and promotion programmes, and lately, I manage and supervise the master of public health students concerning their practicums. I also have worked as a medical interpreter and translator in different healthcare settings. 
I  also have experience of working as a trainer of medical interpretation and translation. Moreover, I have also succeeded in starting and running other community projects in the fields of education, community integration and social justice.</p>

<p>Outside of the public health domain, I have worked with diverse ethnic minority students in primary and secondary schools as a teacher. I also have served as a volunteer and ambassador for different organizations where I leveraged connections, networks and resources to develop actions to achieve the mission of the organizations. I am an avid learner of more than knowledge. I believe in the power of cross-curricular learning, interdependence and positivity. I am fascinated by people, stories, and cultures while I enjoy photography, travelling, and listening to podcasts on diverse subjects.</p>

<p>At the moment, I am enrolled in Health Innovation & Entrepreneurship programme to learn innovation as well as entrepreneurial processes to understand and develop new ideas for creating impact & improving healthcare at Ghent University.</p>

<p>If you are interested or know someone where my experience and skills can be of help, I am happy to work together to create an impact for everyone to lead a healthy life. </p>
